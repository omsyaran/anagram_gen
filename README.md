### Anagram Generator
Anagrams can be generated by using this program. This program is developed by using C++ language. 
The max length of characters used to create anagrams will be 6. The concepts of data structures
are used to solve this problem. For this case, stack and queue are used in order to 
generate the anagrams. The generated anagrams will be stored in a text file.
This is done so that the user can view and use the anagram that is generated to their 
preferences.
